This is the ODE tools for the TNS/E H-series HP/OSS platform (Itanium chipset).

To install, simply uncompress and untar the .tar.Z file to a directory of
your choice, and set both PATH and _RLD_LIB_PATH variables to that dir.

Note: you will need to use the 0551 version of rules.zip with these tools.
