Fixes included in this updated zip file are as follows:

1. Added the B390_WORKPATH1 variable to the list of parameters sent
   to the Service Transfer and Service Packaging processes.  This affects
   only the pkg.runpkgtool.mk file, which adds this parameter to the calls
   to the RunMvsInitSvc and RunMvsSvc classes.  These variables are only
   utilized by build 20041004.0558 and higher of tools.jar.
