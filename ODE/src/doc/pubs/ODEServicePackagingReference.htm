The IBM Open Development Environment (ODE) provides a method for developers
to prepare service packages for installation against existing product installations.

<a NAME="sp_overview"></a><b><a href="#ToC_sp_overview">Overview</a></b></h3>
ODE supports two main types of packaging; initial product packaging (IPP)
and service packaging.&nbsp; IPP is a full and complete package, containing
the entire contents of a product.&nbsp; Service packaging is generally
a partial, or incremental set of files used to update or refresh an existing
software installation.&nbsp; The most important difference between initial
product packaging and service packaging is that not all parts are necessarily
included in a service package.&nbsp; This section of will discuss some
of the features of service packaging.
<h3>
<a NAME="FixStrat"></a><a href="#TOC_FixStrat">Fix Strategies</a></h3>
The determination and collection of the shippable parts is required for
service packaging. What parts should be collected is determined by interrogating
the fix strategy. There are currently two fix strategies that are supported
by ODE:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>refresh</b> - the whole product is shipped
for service
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>cumulative</b> - the parts changed for
this build, plus any parts changed in previous builds, up to, but not including
the original product shipment, are included in the service package (cumulative
has two types - fix and maintenance)
<p>The fix strategy chosen has interesting implications for the complexity
and size of the installable packages to be produced. For example, a refresh
strategy implies the complete superseding of a previously shipped package,
resulting in a package that is the same size as the original product shipment.&nbsp;
The cumulative strategy implies a forced supersede, but a smaller installable
package than the original product. A product will most likely select a
fix strategy and stick with it for the life of the product; however, there
are some platforms which alternate between fix and maintenance type cumulative
fix strategies. This allows the product owner to "clean up" a serviceable
entity if its cumulative package becomes as large as the initial product
package, and start the service stream over again.
