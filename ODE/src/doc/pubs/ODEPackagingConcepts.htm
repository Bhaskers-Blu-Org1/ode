<a NAME="HDRINTRO"></a><a href="#ToC_2">Introduction</a></h1>
The IBM Open Development Environment (ODE) provides a method for developers
to prepare programs for installation, known as packaging, as part of a
development environment.

<a NAME="overview"></a><a href="#ToC_overview">Packaging Overview</a></h1>
ODE supports the creation of platform-specific installable images as part
of a build within a development environment. Typically, each platform has
its own set of package-creation tools that require a particular set of
input files to generate the package. ODE handles the creation of these
input files, the collection of all installable files in one location, and
the execution of the platform's packaging tools, to generate a product
package.&nbsp; It is possible to use ODE to create packages for any of
the supported installation tools from any platform, in that the default
packaging tool used for any platform can be redefined by the user.&nbsp;
This is beneficial when creating packages for multiple installation tools
from the same platform.
<p><b>Common Metadata File (CMF)</b>
<blockquote>The Common Metadata File, or CMF, is a platform-independent
text file that contains the necessary information needed to specify the
contents of a product package. This file is parsed by the ODE packaging
tools, which will in turn generate the platform-specific set of packaging
control files used by each platform's packaging tools. The CMF supports
a series of InstallEntity and File stanzas, which allows complex product
hierarchies to be represented in the final package. See the <a href="ODEPackagingReference.htm#HDRCMF">ODE
Packaging Reference</a> for more detail on the specifications of the CMF.</blockquote>
<b>Types of Packaging</b>
<blockquote>ODE supports two main types of packaging; initial product packaging
(IPP) and service packaging. IPP is a full and complete package, containing
the entire contents of a product. Service packaging is generally a partial,
or incremental set of files used to update or refresh an existing software
installation. The most important difference between initial product packaging
and service packaging is that not all parts are necessarily included in
a service package; therefore, the determination and collection of the shippable
parts is required for service packaging. These features are all supported
by ODE. See the <a href="ODEServicePackagingReference.htm">ODE Service
Packaging Reference</a> for more detail on the specifications of the service
packaging.</blockquote>

<a NAME="targets"></a><a href="#ToC_targets">ODE Packaging Targets</a></h1>
ODE packaging is performed in several steps. These steps are handled by
makefile targets defined in the set of common makefiles delivered with
ODE.&nbsp; Executing the ODE command <b>mk</b> or <b>build</b>, with one
of these predefined targets will perform the specified packaging task.
<p><b>build_all</b>
<blockquote>ODE packaging requires that the parts to be shipped be built
first. This can be accomplished with the target <b>build_all</b>.</blockquote>
<b>gather_all</b>
<blockquote>Once all the files to be packaged have been built, the next
step is to gather all of the files to be shipped in one location. This
is generally accomplished by specifying the following variables in a makefile:
<blockquote><b>TOSTAGE</b> - the top-level directory where all shippable
files are to be copied
<br><b>ILIST</b> - a list of files to be copied from the current directory
<br><b>IDIR</b> - the location, specified as a directory relative to <b>TOSTAGE</b>,
where the list of files specified by <b>ILIST</b> will be copied</blockquote>
This gathering of shippable files is performed by the<i> </i><b>gather_all</b>
target. For packaging on all platforms, this target will execute the standard
ODE <b>install_all</b> target, which copies all files specified by <b>ILIST</b>
to the directory <b>TOSTAGE/IDIR</b>. For packaging on USS, this target
will perform an additional task, which can be run independently by running
the <b>installmvs_all</b> target, and handles the copying of shippable
files from the USS side of an MVS/OE system to a location on the TSO side,
where they can be subsequently packaged.&nbsp; Note that in service packaging,
a separate target,<b> instdep_all,</b> runs during gather_all that performs
a similar task as install_all, but only copies the <i>changed</i> shippable
files in a user's sandbox to the ship tree.</blockquote>
<b>parse_all</b>
<blockquote>Another step that must be completed after all of the files
have been built is to generate the platform-specific control files used
by each platform's packaging tools. The target <b>parse_all</b> can be
used to perform this task. This target facilitates a call to the packaging
tool <a href="ODEPackagingReference.htm#ParserGeneratorInitiator">ParserGeneratorInitiator</a>,
which first parses the CMF, and then generates the packaging control files
based on the contents of CMF.</blockquote>
<b>runpkgtool_all</b>
<blockquote>The last step in creating the package is to call the platform-specific
packaging tools to create the actual install images, using the control
files generated by the <b>parse_all</b> target, and the shippable files
installed by the <b>gather_all</b> target. This can be accomplished with
the <b>runpkgtool_all </b>target, which invokes the relevant package-creation
tools to generate the package. For packaging on USS, a call to the packaging
tool <a href="ODEPackagingReference.htm#RunMvsPkg">RunMvsPkg</a> is made,
which will initiate JCL jobs to call the package-creation tools on the
TSO side of the MVS system.
<p>On all platforms except USS, if <b><a href="ODECommonMakefiles.htm#ToC_UsingPackagingPassesandTools">PKG_GEN_DIST_FILE</a></b>
is defined when <b>runpkgtool_all</b> is invoked a single archive file,
which consists of the contents of the package files, will be created.&nbsp;
Use of a single file makes distributing the package simpler.&nbsp; The
<a href="ODEAdminsGuide.htm#Packaging">Packaging Support</a> table in the
ODE Installation and Administration guide illustrates which install tools
are needed on each platform to install the one-file image created.&nbsp;
Note that this creation of a single distribution file is not supported
for Service Packaging.</blockquote>
<b>package_all</b>
<blockquote>To combine the actions of the previously mentioned packaging
targets, the <b>package_all</b> target can be used. On all platforms except
MVS/USS, this target will execute the commands for the following targets,
in order;
<b>gather_all</b>, <b>parse_all</b>, <b>runpkgtool_all</b> and
on MVS/USS (IPP only), the order is<b> parse_all</b>, <b>gather_all</b>,
<b>runpkgtool_all</b><i>.</i></blockquote>
<b>buildandpackage_all</b>
<blockquote>To further combine the actions of the previously mentioned
packaging targets, the <b>buildandpackage_all</b> target can be used. On
all platforms except MVS/USS, this target will execute the commands for
the following targets, in order; <b>build_all, gather_all, parse_all, runpkgtool_all</b>
and on MVS/USS (IPP only), the order is <b>build_all, parse_all, gather_all,
runpkgtool_all</b><i>.</i></blockquote>
