<p>IBM's WebSphere Studio Workbench (WSWB) is an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE)  based on the open-source Eclipse Project. Products across
IBM are being redesigned and delivered as components that extend the base
WSWB platform. These components, known as plug-ins, are packaged together
as product offerings, known as features.</p>
<p>In this Guide, <tt class="xph">WebSphere Studio Workbench</tt> and <tt class="xph">Workbench</tt> refer to the WebSphere Studio products that are based on the WSWB IDE
and supported by the ODE Build Feature.</p>
<p>In addition to providing an environment for integrated development, the
Workbench enables developers to seamlessly integrate their client applications
into a framework that provides a common and consistent interface for users
of diverse applications.</p>
<p>Developers can use the prepackaged Workbench presentation and functions,
or they can extend and enhance their applications using Workbench extension
points. This can include simple enhancements such as menu items and icons,
or more complex enhancements such as application-specific perspectives and
views. To integrate applications into the Workbench, developers create Eclipse
plug-ins (Java and XML code) which are packaged as features, such as the ODE Build Feature.
Users can easily install and update these features using the Workbench Install/Update
Manager.</p>
