Before packaging this project, you must:

(A) populate the base directory with the confs.zip and rules.zip files
    (e.g., ode5.0_b20041004.0550_confs.zip).
    The full names are referenced in build.properties, which you must
    edit appropriately if using newer versions of these files.  Note
    that these files must only end in "confs.zip" and "rules.zip", so
    you do not have to use the full names; however, it is suggested
    to use the same version as the tools (see (B) below) and use the
    full filenames such that the release/build is knowable at a glance.
    
(B) populate the linux and win32 subdirectories with the contents of
    their respective ODE tools files
    (e.g., the contents of ode5.0_b20041004.0550_x86_linux_2.zip for
    the linux directory).
